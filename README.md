# Mixed-Reality-Headset_python-RaspberryPi
# Final year project | Mechatronics and Control Engineering

This project aims to build a low cost solution of Mixed Reality Headset (similar to HoloLens).

It uses Raspberry Pi 3b+ as the main microcontroller, and libraries of Python are used for coding most of the features.
To display the augmented graphics on the headset, Unity 3D and Visual Studio are used.
Following is the breakdown of project:

# Tasks done in Python

(1)- Hand Gesture Recognation 
(2)- QR code scanning
(2)- Sensor data acquiring (for head movement tracking)
(3)- Serial communication (sending to Unity 3D)

# Tasks done in Unity 3D

(1)- Models of machine parts
(2)- Serial communication (receiving from Raspberry Pi)
(3)- Using the received data to interact with the objects.
