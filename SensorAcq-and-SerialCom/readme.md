Yaw, pitch, and roll angles are calculated from GY-85 sensor
The code for YPR angles are in these two files:

  main_code.py   and    main_functions.py

Before runing these code files, some libraries need to be installed.
The procedure for installing the libraries is given in this [link](https://github.com/fhd-codes/GY-85_Raspberry-Pi)
